PROJECT FILES

index.html: This is the main page, which opens the map in the browser. Additionally, this page also initializes and sets up the buttons that simplify and clear the page. 
mapLayer.js: This file initializes the open source map from leaflet, and the navigation bar that draws the polylines. These lines are saved to a GeoJSON layer to set up the simplification.
style.css: This page provides minimal styling to the page, map and buttons.
